# FragranceCollection
Recently, I have become very interested in fragrances. In this project, I look to create an improved version of websites like [Fragrantica](http://fragrantica.com/) and [Basenotes](http://basenotes.net).
These sites lack functionality and modern design. I hope to create a platform in which users can share their fragrance collection and find how to acquire a fragrance that is not in their collection.
The main web application is built in Django. I plan to integrate eBay Product Services API and ScentSee REST API into my application.
